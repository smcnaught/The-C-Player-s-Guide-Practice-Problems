`stack trace contains the path of the methods we called`

What is the heap?
`A set of objects connected by references`
`When we need memory in arbitrary sizes, we ditch the stack and use the heap.`
`Reference types are stored on the heap and include a reference to where on the heap they're stored`

What is a garbage collector?
`The garbage collector cleans up unused things on the heap. It lets heap memory be reused.`
`Not used on the stack. The stack manages itself.`

What is a value type?
`Value types directly contain their data. They have a known, fixed size.`
`The values types are: All numeric types (int, double, long, etc.), bool, struct, char`

What is a reference type? 
`A reference type variable stores a reference to where it's data is stored in memory(on the heap)`

`You can use the .Equals() method. (compares values)                                 Example: obj1.Equals(obj2);`

Describe the four principles of object oriented programming.
`1. Encapsulation: hiding data by restricting access to public methods (marking them private).`
`2. Abstraction: a class should not know the inner details of another in order to use it (should just know the interfaces).`
`3. Inheritance: let's you derive new classes based on existing ones. "is a" or "has a" relationships between objects. derived class(child) & base class(parent)`
`4. Polymorphism: lets a derived class override members declared in it's base class.`
  - `Members with 'virtual' can be overridden.`
  - `Use 'override' keyword to override in derived class.`
  - `Two versions of polymorphism: **compile-time** (static, adhoc, early binding) & **runtime** (dynamic, inclusion, subtyping, late binding)`
    - `Compile-Time Examples: Method overloading, constructor overloading and operator overloading`
    - `Runtime Examples: Method overriding, which involves inheritance and virtual functions`

What is an interface?
`Defines the methods, properties, etc. that need to exist on any class that implements it.`

What is a struct?
`Similar to a class, just defines a simple data structure. Cannot be used in inheritance. Can have constructors, fields, methods, properties, etc.`

What is a record?
`object that is data-centric, immutable and has value semantics (equal if all members are equal)`
`cannot create static records`
`public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);`

When to use a struct vs. class vs. record?
`Can your data type be a value type? Go with struct.`
`Does your data describe a value-like, immutable state? Go with record`
`Otherwise, go with class`

What are generics?
`Solve the problem of needing to make classes or methods that would differ only by the types they use`
`Example: the methods I made that change casing or if your types share the properties you need to access but not all the same props`
`public void Add(T newValue) {}`

What does the static keyword mean?
`Means the item is owned by the type itself rather than the instance. It's shared across all instances.`
`Classes, fields, methods, and constructors can be static. If a class is static, all members must be static`

What is a dictionary?
`data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs`
`Dictionary keys should not change`

How do you define a method with a variable number of parameters?
`Using the 'params' keyword`
`Define: public void DoStuff(params string[] words) {}`
`Then call like this - DoStuff("a"); or "DoStuff("a", "b", "c");`

What is passing by reference?
`Allows two methods to share a variable and it's memory location directly.`
`Allows method to directly affect the calling method's variables, which is powerful but risky`
`Avoids costs of copying large value types when method is called`
`Define: public void DisplayNumber(ref int x) {}   Call: DisplayNumber(ref y);`

What is an output parameter?
`A method defines an out parameter using the 'out' keyword and that value is automatically returned by the method.`
`Example declaration: public void DoThing(out int value) { value = 22 };`
`Example Call:        double x; DoThing(out x); // Now x = 22`

What is an extension method?
`A static method that gives the appearance of being attached to another type as an instance method.`
`So you can extend one method to do more things`
`Use the 'this' keyword before the first parameter to make it an extension method.`

How do you define optional parameters in C#?
`Give them a default value. Example: public void DoSomething(int y = 3) {}`

How to maintain stack trace when throwing exception?
`If you rethrow an exception ('throw e'), you will reset the stack trace. However, just using 'throw' will maintain the trace and bubble the error up.`

What is multi-threading? multithreading
`Creating multiple threads allows you to do more than one thing at a time. Run multiple versions of your application`
`A *thread* is an independent execution path in a program`
`Each thread gets its own stack, but they all share the same heap (allowing them to share data)`

What is a deadlock? concurrency related issue
`When a thread is stuck waiting to acquire a lock but will never acquire it because another thread has aquired it and is stalled.`
`Metaphor: Imagine you need both a keyboard and mouse to do a job. I grab the keyboard and you grab the mouse. I'm waiting for you to be done with the mouse and you're waiting for me to be done with the keyboard. We will both wait forever.`

What is asynchronous programming?
`lets task run in the background. scheduling tasks to continue or callbacks to happen when the async task completes.`
`Task (no return value) and Task<T>(has return value) classes can be used to schedule tasks to run async.`

`Determined by explicitly using the 'unsafe' keyword.`
`Allows you to reference and manipulate memory locations directly`

What is IDisposable?
`It is used to release managed and unmanaged resources`
`Lets you run your own logic on an object before it's garbage collected.`
`Call Dispose() to clean up - can lead to memory leaks if you don't`

What is the difference between managed and unmanaged resources?
`Unmanaged resources are not directly under the control of the garbage collector`
`Unmanaged code is sometimes called "native code"`

What is a partial class?
`Allows slices of the class to be defined in separate files.`
`Use the 'partial' keyword to define`

What is reflection?
`used to retrieve metadata on types at runtime.`

What is a dynamic object?
`An object that can be defined at creation time and allows methods and properties to be added/removed as the program runs.`
`Built using the 'IDynamicMetaObjectProvider' interface, deriving from the 'DynamicObject' class, or using the 'ExpandoObject' class (ExpandoObject is the simplest).`
`Should stick to statically typed objects unless you have a good reason not to.`
`Can emulate dynamic objects with dictionaries instead.`

What is dynamic type checking?
`A variable is dynamically typed if it uses the 'dynamic' keyword. Example: dynamic text = "Hello World";`
`Variables including parameters and return types have no fixed type.`
`The compiler can't check if a given method call will work.`
`Should stick to statically typing your variables unless you have a good reason not to.`

What is a Pointer?
`Allows you to reference a specific memory address`
`Typically used in unsafe code`
`Declared by using a "*". Example: int* p; // A pointer to an integer`

What does a "Fixed" statement do?
`Lets you "pin" managed references in place so a Pointer can reference them`
`A "fixed-size array" or "fixed-size buffer" stores its data within a struct instead of on the heap (size of array remains same).`

What is a stack allocation?
`Placing an array's memory on the stack instead of the heap.`
`Done by using "stackalloc" keyword. Example: int* numbers = stackalloc int[10];`
`Only allowed in unsafe context, for local variables and only for unmanaged types`
